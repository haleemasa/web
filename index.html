        After completing my PhD I joined Imperial College London as <u>Research
        Associate in Machine Learning and Data Mining</u> and served for around 2
        years. I am still an honorary member of Imperial College London.
        Later on I served National Health Services and worked as a
        <u>Bioinformatician and Systems Admin</u> at Royal Brompton and
        Harefield hospital for around two years in the Department of Genetics.
        Again, I am still an honorary member of NHS to consult them in various
        technical issues.
        Currently, I am serving University College London as the Senior Research
        Associate DevOps in the department of Physics and Biomedical Engineering.

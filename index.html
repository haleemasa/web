        Haleema sadia 
        In 2019-20, I completed my PhD in Education with focus on "Female Pakistani students' identities
        in transition to UK higher education" from University of Manchester, UK. 
        I developed research and analytical skills by implicating a complex socio-cultural theoretical framework 
        to conduct a longitudinal study using photo elicitation, timeline, concept mapping and narrative methodology.
    </p>
    I have more than 20 years of professional experience in teaching study skills, 
    educational research methods, theories of teaching and learning, project management and academic supervision
    at undergraduate and postgraduate levels in various academic institutions at the UK and abroad.
